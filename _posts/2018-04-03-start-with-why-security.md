title: Start with Why Security?
---

Securing data is hard. Products change frequently. People and leadership change. The hallmark of a great security program is the ability to ride the wave of change. But often, security halts innovation. It gums up the gears, and slows progress to a halt. If this happens, security becomes ineffective. Ultimately pointless. Let’s talk about how business momentum and high security can coexist. It requires a focus on why security matters.

## Common Whys

This is a list of some common reasons why security matters. 

### Do you hold lives in your hands?

This is a broad category including autonomous cars, robotic surgery arms, missile guidance systems, and airplanes.The health record system at your hospital the doctor uses to treat your medical conditions. 

My father was in the ICU after surgery, and his IV was fed drugs from a network attached pharmaceutical delivery machine. Hacking that machine could cause it to malfunction, report misleading information, or cause him to over dose.

### Altruistic Ideals

Privacy and freedom are not a given for many people living on this planet. A failed security control could expose an activist. A battered woman fleeing her abuser may inadvertently reveal her location in a photo with location information. Maintaining a secure platform for people to communicate freely is the hallmark of a free society, and suppression of opinion and open discussion surpasses people’s liberty.

###  Close Enterprise Deals

Sometimes you need strong security to gain and maintain customer relationships. If a customer is going to store information that can affect their ability to conduct business, then they will require you to jump through hoops to gain their business. Depending on the enterprise, they may have regulations demanding a certain level of security.

### Customer Trust

Customers will not entrust their sensitive information with you if they do not trust you. We saw this when facebook was forced to admit they let a third party leach information about 30 million users, and then use that information to affect a presidential election. Facebook dipped 10% in market value. Losing customer trust may mean the death of your company.

### Consumer Personal Information

Getting someone’s personal information can be the key to resetting passwords on their bank accounts and transferring their life savings away. We don’t want to let people steal money from people. It can keep them from obtaining credit when they need a car to commute to work, or reduce their retirement to a level that puts them under the poverty line. 


### Intelectual Secrets

Sometimes, the lifeblood of a company is maintaining their secret sauce, whether that’s the latest research on pharmaceutical, material sciences, or google’s search ranking algorithm. Protecting this data protects the employee’s time and the company’s well being.

### Regulatory Space

If your industry is in a highly regulated space, you may be fined out of existence if you fail to meet security standards. Regulations tend to exist to protect consumers or health and safety. Ignoring them is irresponsible, even if some of them are antiquated and pointless. I believe following regulations for the sake of being compliant is the wrong approach. If you can use the regulations to justify a worthwhile goal, then you kill two birds with a single stone.

## Simple Prioritization Model

You cannot do all of security all at once. You must know why to begin to prioritize. Pick and choose the biggest win for your time and money, execute, and repeat. 

Choosing correctly is the real challenge. If you do not know the answer, hire experts to help you. Even consultants to get you on your way. We’ll talk about what the to-do list in another post.

Below is a framework of how we bucket security initiatives, whether they are bugs, or compliance requirements.

### Blockers

There are some things that must block all company progress. 

This is a category that must be used sparingly. You will have the horror of using this category on occasion. An example is in 2017, when Apple released a new operating system and anyone who typed in “root” as a user, with a blank password, could login and bypass all other passwords.

### Rule of Three

For the rest, we apply the rule of three.

#### 1. High Priority

This is the category of being the very next thing that gets worked on. Maybe the team is about to launch a product and cannot delay. The security issue is there, but not something that anyone can immediately exploit. The tradeoff is your team will work the very next day to address and deploy with a fix.

#### 2. Med Priority

These are things that must happen within a few weeks. Maybe a dev made a mistake in a process, like including some low privilege credentials in source code. The fix is complicated, and rushing will likely introduce more security holes. The fix will happen, but it’s not going to block forward momentum.

#### 2. Low Priority

These are nice to haves. They go on the backlog, and you lobby for them like any other product feature or tech debt. If they seem like they will never get fixed, and they really do affect security, you’ll have to convince others, or they are not important.

With so many directions to go, where do you choose from? What is sufficient security for various stages? This ultimately depends on why you’re doing security. That’s the topic for the next post. What makes a security program.


## Conclusion

While consulting for healthcare, lot of people spent a lot of time working on PCI. The company wanted to avoid paying huge fines. But, while people worked on PCI, they neglected the security of the health care network and a huge virus broke out. The entire hospital fell back to pen and paper. Health records were no longer available. People lost track of why they provide security. Protecting patient care systems is always the first priority. 

Knowing why you do security can help when you’re resource constrained and must make tough tradeoffs. Start with why.
